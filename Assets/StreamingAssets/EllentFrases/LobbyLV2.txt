Now what?
Talk with the Grenadier? You mean that sleeping robot?
Mods? What are Mods?
So you are telling me that if I bring with me the Mods that the grenadier gives me I'll have special effects for the next mission?
That is actually cool.
I could become Flash and see all the land in seconds.
I could become immortal or kill anyone in one shot.
I just need to decide what to bring for the next mission.
I should open more chests from now on.
