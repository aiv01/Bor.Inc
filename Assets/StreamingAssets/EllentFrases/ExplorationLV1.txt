How did I even get here?
So... Bor.Inc is the company name? It sounds kinda "Boring"
Is Explorer@ really my name? That's so wierd...
Wait... what do you mean with "The boss is always watching"?!?
Who is the Boss?!?
ANSWER ME!       NOW!!!
Who even am I?
Hellooo... Robot voice... Are you still there?
Why should I even continue this mission in an unamed land? What am I even doing it for?
I need to meet the boss... I need answers... There must be an explanation to this situation
Mabe the boss can tell me who I am...
I hate my name... How can Explorer@ even be considered a name?
Maybe I'll be able to find the boss by compleating my missions
Ok, I must finish these missions!
