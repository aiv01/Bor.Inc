I still don't get why these monsters don't bleed, they just disappear in particles...
almost like they are not real... like holograms... like simulations...
There must be something deeper in this story, there are so many things that don't make any sense.


Why am I here, I really hope the boss could help...


This is getting really boring... Now I get the company name. I'm really hating running arround like this.
If I was the boss, I'd run this company much so better... And I'll find someone else to do this work for me.



At least the mods are cool, right? Right!

What even is this treasure that I'm collecting for the boss?
