Wait... The Boss... Is... ME?!?!?! What's going on?!?!?!
Welcome, Explorer@, my name is Explorer1, the first clone of Ellen^
Ellen?
Yes Ellen, she was the owner of the company after her grandad passed away^
But she wanted more gain, she needed to find treasures faster than the old mechanic granadeers, and created us, the clones^
So I'm a clone?!?!?
But she did't expect from me to kill her and get her place...^
And when I did... I created chompers and spitters so that nobody else could reach me...^
but...^
You, Explorer@ made it here, and I am not ready to leave, you shall die now^
Wait... WHAT?!?!
