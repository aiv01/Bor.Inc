Is it only my impression or are these lands getting bigger every time?
And are those Gredaniers walking around?
There are a lot more monsters than the last times, almost like someone doesn't want me to proceed.
More fun for me...

I think I calculated where the Boss might hide... Time to go pay them a visit.


I hate working for someone I don't know, I didn't agree to any of this!
